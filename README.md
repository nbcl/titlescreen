## What is this?

> If you write a message in this repository it will appear on the start screen of my text editor.

Titlescreen is a [Startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify) fork with an added [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions) workflow intended to display [issues](https://github.com/nbcl/titlescreen/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22%F0%9F%91%8D+Accepted%22) on my Vim start screen.

## Write your message

To write a message, simply [write an issue](https://github.com/nbcl/titlescreen/issues/new?template=message.md&title=Write+your+message+here) and leave your message in the title, [@actions](https://github.com/actions/) will do the rest.

## Message history

You can check out recent messages [here](https://github.com/nbcl/titlescreen/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22%F0%9F%91%8D+Accepted%22) and a list with all the messages [here](MESSAGES.md).
